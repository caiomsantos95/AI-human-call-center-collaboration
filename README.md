# AI-Human Call Center Collaboration Dashboard
This project presents a conceptual dashboard designed to facilitate collaboration between AI agents and human managers in a call center environment. In this envisioned system, AI agents handle customer calls autonomously, while human managers act as second-tier validators, overseeing operations and intervening when necessary.

## Overview
As AI technology advances, the dynamics of customer service are shifting towards AI-driven interactions. This dashboard prototype explores how interfaces can evolve to support effective AI-human collaboration, ensuring seamless customer experiences and efficient issue resolution.

## Features
- Real-Time Monitoring: Human managers can observe live AI-customer interactions, providing transparency into ongoing operations.

- AI Assistance Requests: AI agents can proactively seek human intervention when encountering complex or ambiguous situations, ensuring appropriate handling of challenging cases.

- Managerial Intervention: Human managers have the capability to step in during live interactions if they identify potential issues, maintaining service quality and customer satisfaction.

## Purpose
This project serves as a brainstorming exercise to envision the future of AI-human collaboration interfaces in customer service settings. It aims to inspire discussions and developments on how such interfaces can be designed to enhance operational efficiency and service quality in an AI-driven world.

## Usage
Currently, this project is a conceptual prototype and is not intended for deployment. It serves as a foundation for further exploration and development in the realm of AI-human collaborative interfaces.
